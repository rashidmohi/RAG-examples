# RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Examples
### Few simple examples of RAG 
*Feb 2025*


## Motivation
As the LLM-based applications are becoming mainstream, most of us in developer community are trying to get our hands on the related libraries, concepts and patterns. However, it's not easy to find code examples or most of the examples are using openai that's not developer friendly with it's limited free-tier. So, I plan to develop and share few simple examples of RAG
Happy coding!
